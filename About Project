- Summary table showing total medicines, quantity, and value

### 2. Data Structure
Medicines are stored in an array of objects, each containing:
- Name
- Quantity
- Price

### 3. Core Functions

#### a. Add Medicine
- Adds a new medicine to the inventory
- Validates input fields
- Updates the inventory table and summary

#### b. Remove Medicine
- Removes a medicine from the inventory by name
- Updates the inventory table and summary

#### c. Modify Medicine
- Updates the quantity and price of an existing medicine
- Updates the inventory table and summary

#### d. Print Receipt
- Calculates the total price for a given medicine and quantity
- Displays the total price or error message

### 4. Helper Functions

#### a. updateTable()
- Refreshes the inventory table with current data

## Strengths
1. **Simplicity**: The entire system is contained in a single HTML file, making it easy to deploy and use.
2. **User-friendly Interface**: The interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
3. **Real-time Updates**: The inventory table and summary are updated immediately after each action.
4. **Flexibility**: The system can handle various pharmacy management tasks efficiently.

## Limitations
1. **Data Persistence**: The current implementation does not save data between sessions. Refreshing the page will reset the inventory.
2. **Security**: There are no authentication or authorization measures in place.
3. **Scalability**: For large inventories, the performance might degrade as all data is kept in memory.

## Potential Improvements
1. Implement data persistence using local storage or a backend database.
2. Add user authentication and role-based access control.
3. Implement sorting and searching functionality for the inventory table.
4. Add data validation and error handling for edge cases.
5. Improve the UI with more sophisticated styling and responsive design.
6. Implement reporting features (e.g., sales reports, low stock alerts).

## Conclusion
The Pharmacy Management System provides a solid foundation for basic pharmacy inventory management. Its simplicity and ease of use make it suitable for small pharmacies or as a starting point for more complex systems. With further development and the suggested improvements, it could be evolved into a more robust and feature-rich application.
